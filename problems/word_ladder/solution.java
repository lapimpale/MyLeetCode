    Approach:
    Similar to BFS, we will start from beginWord and insert that into a queue
    now from this word, we will see all possible words we can reach by replacing one character
    at a time with any character lying between a to z.
    If new word equals endWord and exists in dictionary we will return there adding 1 to counter.
    If new word exists in our dictionary, we will add that in our queue and remove that
    from our dictionary. We will do this for all possible words.
    Now whatever words are there in queue, they will be of same level 
    (those words have been reached from same level word). So once all words of queue are processed at a 
    level, we will increase our counter.
